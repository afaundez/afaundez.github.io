<dfn>Mesh Suite</dfn> is a Qt4 app designed and developed for my Computer Engineering thesis <cite>Experimentation Framework for 2D Triangulations Refining Algorithms</cite> in 2010.

The main motivation for this project was to provide a tool for researching and comparing different approaches of Delaunay refinements.
